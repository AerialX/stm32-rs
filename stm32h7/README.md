# stm32h7
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to STM32H7 peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.stm32h7]
version = "0.1.0"
features = ["stm32h7x3"]
```

Include the "rt" feature to bring in support for `cortex-m-rt` as well.

For details on the autogenerated API, please see:

## Supported Devices
