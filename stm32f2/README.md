# stm32f2
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to STM32F2 peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.stm32f2]
version = "0.2.0"
features = ["stm32f215", "rt"]
```

The `rt` feature is optional and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.

For details on the autogenerated API, please see:

* STM32F215
